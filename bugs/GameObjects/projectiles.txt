Based on current design for Projectiles, there seems to be a strange "inconsistancy"(maybe?) :

When jumping up and down wildly, and shooting right (for example), and also NOT having the projectile "delete"(dead=true) itself
after detecting collision, it INTENTIONALLY (for testing) "sticks" the projectile to the surface it detected collision with.
There seems to be a consistant bug where the top 1 or 2 pixels of, for example, a one block collidable object will not allow any
projectiles to stick to it, leaving an empty 1 or 2 pixels at the top, that won't ever be filled in by a projectile colliding with it
and sticking like intended (intended during testing). Maybe it's using the same "forgiveness buffer" that I use for player movement
to allow the player SQUARE BLOCK to fit into a 1 tile/block opening, between two solid tiles/blocks, without being PRECICELY positioned
TO THE TEE with the 1 block opening. I believe I have a float (the position of player) converted into an int, which allows any position 
within the float value of .01 up to .99 to be converted into an int (thus rounding all numbers inbetween .01 and .99 as a straight "0")
and therefore is treated as if it's not colliding.

Problem with projectile initial spawn:
Occasionally when moving around and firing in any direction (i think? mostly noticed with right/up/left shooting) you will occasionally
notice that the point/pixels in which the projectile spawns at are off by one, in the direction of movement(aka shooting, since shooting
direction is momentarily tied to movement for easy testing)
